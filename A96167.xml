            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Three things more let me ſay to the reader, and I have done.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> Wonder not, this Anſwer ſtaid ſo long, for it had certainly taken his narrative by the heele, but that ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall providence (whoſe diſtracted lines) intercepted; the truth is, I thought it ſhould neede no other Anſwer then it ſelfe; untill I perceived ſome ill effects of it.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> But why doe I undertake this worke? Anſwer,
<pb facs="tcp:124596:3"/> 
               <hi>1.</hi> I am one of the <hi>neareſt kinſmen</hi> to thoſe Churches of any other man in theſe parts, and therefore I take my ſelfe bound to <hi>the name of my Brethren</hi> (in a righteous way) and (not let it die) through my neglect. <hi>2.</hi> Few or none are here, have had more experience of <hi>New-England</hi> Church courſes then my ſelfe, through many yeares continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with them, and to whom I am returning when God makes way: and am therefore able to ſpeake on certainty, and with conſcience where <hi>W. R.</hi> departs from the truth in his relations. <hi>3.</hi> I have beene preſſed by word of mouth, and ſundry letters to doe it; therefore if I ſhould hold my peace when I am called to ſpeake, and ſee ſo many innocent Churches ſuffer, I ſhould not lift up my face to God, nor my Brethren there. <hi>God knowes</hi> my ſpirit, how exceeding loath I was to controvert with a Brother, (though but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant) and to uncover his nakedneſſe, but when God calls I am bound with <hi>Moſes,</hi> (when he ſaw the Ebrew did wrong to his Brother) to ſay, <hi>why ſmiteſt thou thy fellow?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 2.13.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> Touching the anſwer it ſelfe, ſome things I would ſay, <hi>1</hi> I thinke it not meete to anſwer all I could, nor to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular, eſpecially in his Marginall extravagances, that would be too tedious; For our principall paſſages being anſwered unto, the reſt will fall of themſelves. <hi>2.</hi> Nor to anſwer any thing in his booke, ſo oft as hee repeates it, for divers things are fetched over by him, ſome three, ſome foure ſeverall times; what his reaſons are, himſelfe can beſt give
<pb facs="tcp:124596:4"/> account. <hi>3.</hi> Neither is it poſsible for me to anſwer <hi>the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> of his private letters lying by him, (ſuch a ground of Church ſtories as I never heard of,) becauſe I know nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who they are, nor what their owne words are, or if I did, were it materiall. <hi>4.</hi> Thou ſeeſt I have a three fold worke to anſwer: <hi>1.</hi> his Articles, <hi>2</hi> his quotations, <hi>3</hi> his Margent. All which I have indeavored faithfully as in Gods preſence to doe: what overſight or infirmity hath paſſed my penne therein, I crave thy pardon, for we are weake men and (God knowes) too apt to forget our ſelves in greater things then theſe. <hi>5.</hi> What I here write, is onely from my ſelfe, (if any weakeneſſe appeare) impute it not I pray thee to the caſe in hand, or our Churches iudgements there, but to my owne frailty rather. <hi>6.</hi> Nor is it my ſcope to diſcuſſe the points of Diſcipline, (that worke is in abler hands) but I looke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his booke, as an hiſtoricall narration, and accordingly I frame my anſwer. <hi>7.</hi> Though he brings not the words of any of his Authors cited (which had been fairer, and might have kept him in cloſer bonds) yet I have done it for him, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the laſt ſixe or eight Chapters, that you may iudge whether hee hath dealt fairely with them or no. <hi>8.</hi> When I recite <hi>W. R.</hi> his words in his narration, you will ſee I have dealt candidly with him, either mentioning his <hi>very words,</hi> or ſo many of them as containe their full ſtrength, whereto my anſwer tends. <hi>9.</hi> When at any time, in my anſwer, I ſay, ſuch an Article, or ſuch a clauſe is <hi>untrue,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:124596:4"/> or is <hi>falſe;</hi> I am not willing to impute the falſity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to the Authors knowledge, (I would iudge otherwiſe of him then ſo,) but to the thing it ſelfe aſſerted; which may be done through his miſinformation, or miſtake: I will ſay no more; but commit thy ſpirit to the wiſe guidance of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lights, who in Chriſt Jeſus leade thee by the hand into all truth and peace.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T would grieve a tender heart to heare this man <hi>call God and his Conſcience to witneſſe how highly he honours and loves thoſe that are in Church waies,</hi> and by and by to aſſault with horrible untruths, and bitter invectives the Churches of <hi>New-England,</hi> (whom God hath beene pleaſed to honour in the hearts of thouſands of his pretious Saints) which one would thinke hardly credible, that any that goeth under the notion of honeſty, much leſſe of godlineſſe, ſhould venture to doe.</p>

                  <hi>that were and are in London, for breaking a ſolemne agreement; to produce a narrative of their Doctrine and practiſe, and yet did not, yea would not perform<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Some of us profeſſe ſolemnely we never ſo much as heard of any promiſe, therefore were farre enough from breaking it; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> why then doth <hi>W. R.</hi> lay it upon the Independent Brethren in <hi>London</hi> without exception?</p>
               <p n="2">2. What was done by any of them herein, was freely from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (as I am informed by them) that by ſome manifeſtation of their Judgements and practiſes, they might cleare themſelves from miſapprehenſions and miſtakes; ſo that if they did it not, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were like to ſuffer moſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This they made performance of in their late Apologie, ſo farre as might ſatisfie in a rationall way, but if hee expected more, where lies the fault?</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:124596:6"/>4. If they did not this, ſo ſoone as hee would have had them, let him know, the extreame diſtractions of theſe times, and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique ſervice of ſome of theſe brethren (who were imployed by the State, for a good ſpace together) might juſtly hinder greater things then this. Now, ſee what little cauſe the Narratour had to caſt ſuch a blot on the names of his <hi>Honored Brethren</hi> (as he calles them.)</p>

                  </label> 1. Such contemptuous ſpeeches, &amp; reproachfull carriages caſt upon our Brethren of the Churches here, neither are, or ever were allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by us: yea our owne examples, practiſings, writings doe, and (we hope) ever ſhall beare witneſſe againſt ſuch looſe and laviſh ſpirits and practiſes: And can any man then juſtly impute them unto us?<note place="margin">Pſal. 11.3.</note> May we not ſay with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>If the foundations be caſt downe, what hath the innocent done?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. They are not alone in theſe reproches, our ſelves alſo are fellow-ſufferers with them herein, from divers Sectaries now in <hi>London,</hi> whoſe uſuall tones &amp; dialects theſe words (he mentions) are, &amp; not the voyce of Independents.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> 
                  <hi>That ſome of our way (contrary to our promiſe and Pactions) have impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly, both in Pulpit and Preſſe laboured to promote the popular governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; to make all men diſreliſh and abominate the Presbyterian way.</hi>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> A ſad complaint if true; But to ſhew how farre from this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and practiſe we have beene, conſider firſt how loath wee were to appeare in the caſe, who, though we had bookes of this ſubject rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for the preſſe, yet by joynt conſent ſuppreſſed them, (haply to the great detriment of our cauſe) for that wee were unwilling to blow a fire.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When we did appeare in Pulpit or Preſſe, whether it was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inſtigation or no, and how ſparing wee have beene, ever ſince, (untill ſome late forced replyes) and how inoffenſive in our carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and preachings, we leave to all godly to judge.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Inſtance (but) in the Holland Brethrens Apologie; was it <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuouſly done,</hi> was it A MOCK NARRATIVE, A MEERE GVLL? (as this man moſt abuſively ſtyles it) was it not rather <hi>full of Peaceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, modeſty and candor, and ſeaſonably needefull?</hi> as that Reverend man affirmed in Print.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Doth not <hi>W. R.</hi> know that about this time of promiſes and Pactions, or a while after our Brethren, of the Presbyterian way did
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:124596:6"/> write a Letter into <hi>Scotland</hi> with many of their hands to it, telling the Miniſters there they did approve of their Governement, and would joyne in the furtherance of it. Now for him to binde our hands, and ſeale up our mouthes, and then underhand at the ſame time to fore-determine the matter, and bee ingaged in that way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any ſolemne diſpute, and yet to accuſe us for breaking Pacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſeemes neither rationall nor faire. Other things I ſhall ſpeake to the Preface afterwards in anſwer to the booke: Onely this, he will make the Reader beleeve, (to foreſtall him) <hi>that there are ſome ſeeming contradictions in our Tenets &amp; apparent repugnances to the letter of Scripture, or light of common ſenſe.</hi> But what reall contradictions are in his Narrative, and manifeſt repugnances in his Animadverſions, to Scripture rules, light of reaſon, and common ſenſe too, (by the helpe of God) I ſhall make to appeare, but with a ſad heart (I muſt tell him) that ſuch things ſhould be written by a Brother whom we have ſo much eſteemed and reverenced: but ſeeing now it is done (rather then ſo many pretious Saints and Churches ſhould ſuffer wrongfully) I am forced to uncover. If others be rightly informed and himſelfe convinced, I have my ends.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>To the Narration in generall.</head>
               <p>AS he ſaith, hee had laid by the thoughts of it a good while, through many diſcouragements. So (I conceive) if he had caſt them by for ever, &amp; made the place of conception their grave, he had dealt better for the truth and himſelfe. But he is very angry for want of Narratives. One he muſt have, and one he will have, be it right or wrong, and if neither <hi>New-England</hi> nor <hi>Holland</hi> Brethren bee worth a Narrative, let him come, he will frame one himſelfe. And this ſhall be no MOCK NARRATIVE, NO MEERE GVLL, as the <hi>Holland</hi> Brethren produced, but a more ſolid thing: Now what it is will appeare if we weigh three things.</p>
               <p>That the grounds on which hee builds it, are ſandie and inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> 
               </p>
               <p>The manner of his proceeding, unloving and irregular. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> 
               </p>
               <p>The matter of it, 1. Full of groſſe miſtakes, contrarieties to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> truth, and contradictions to it ſelfe. 2. His quotations abuſed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely, and wreſted. 3. His Marginall notes, very ſcandalous and offenſive. And according to this method, we will proceede, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to make all theſe particulars good in our anſwer.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:124596:7"/>
               <head>Firſt for his grounds.</head>
               <p>You would thinke that the grounds on which all his worke is founded, and all <hi>New-England</hi> Churches taxed, had neede bee ſound, even, adequate, or elſe hee will not prove himſelfe a wiſe builder. But they are theſe three. 1. <hi>Our owne printed Bookes.</hi> 2. <hi>Private letters.</hi> 3. <hi>Other good intelligences,</hi> (as himſelfe ſaith in his Title.)</p>
               <p>For the printed bookes which he quotes, they are the writings of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> ſome godly and learned men there: But that theſe be rightly concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, know 1. Theſe bookes (five in number) are not written from all the Elders, two of them but from one only; Another from ſome few, none of them from all. 2. Not written to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches here, as a Platforme of our practiſe, but ſent as an anſwer to ſome one or more Brethren in England that deſired ſatisfaction to ſome quaetees of their owne (whereof <hi>W. R.</hi> himſelfe was one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) 3. Nor intended by them for the preſſe, much leſſe to be made a ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard to prove our Churches opinions and waies by, but publiſhed by ſome well-minded here, without their knowledge, yea againſt the mindes of ſome of them. Yet if he had kept cloſe to theſe in his narration, he had ſaved his credit, and my paines, but (you ſhall ſee) he hath ſo abuſed and wreſted them (I dare ſay in wel-neere an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred places) that his aſſertions are, not their ſayings and words, but his owne, and they will leave him to quit himſelfe as well as he can; For as Scripture it ſelfe (the rule of all things) abuſed is no Scripture, ſo the writings of men perverted are no more theirs. This we ſhall make plentifully appeare.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> 
                  <hi>Sundry private letters lying by him,</hi> (as hee ſaith) <hi>ſent from New-England;</hi> (but names only two letters of their names) are another ground of his ſtory.

               <p n="3">3. Suppoſe none of the mentioned exceptions can be had, but that the writers of the letters be as honeſt, ſound, able men as can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, and ſuppoſe we could be aſſured of the particulars recited;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:124596:8"/> yet all this will not ſerve, becauſe they are but ſingle men, and write as private perſons, their own thoughts, not as be truſted by any commiſſion from the Churches, to write their common Judgements. Therefore no ground to eſteeme their letters of ſuch authenticall force, unleſſe he can prove they were allowed by the Churches, or were men Apoſtolicall, that could not erre in writing. 4 If this be a good ground to prove Churches judgements by private letters: marke what abſurdities will enſue. 1. That we muſt believe that the Churches of <hi>New-England</hi> denie a power of votes, ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to the people, becauſe Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> a Paſtour there wrote ſo.

R.</hi>) that the Churches and Miniſters in <hi>Old-England,</hi> doe <hi>generally</hi> allow ſuch impoſitions. 3. Then any few envious or malicious perſons in a Church, may bring a ſcandall (unavoydable) upon any Church in the world, if what they ſay and hold ſhould be accounted the Churches judgement, where they live. 4. Then the Churches of <hi>England</hi> are all Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and Familiſticall, becauſe (on our knowledge) ſuch letters have been written from ſome in theſe Churches as profeſſedly mainetaine ſuch opinions: how abſurd theſe concluſions would be, let any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d fferent man judge.</p>
               <p n="5">5.

               <p>For there was a time in <hi>New-England</hi> (for ſome few yeares ſpace) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch a law was made, and then Churches did uſe to gather, without any notice given to Magiſtrates or other Churches.</p>
               <p>But after the opinions grew on, and experience diſcovered the danger, there was a law made that none muſt conſtitute any Church but firſt give notice thereof to Magiſtrates and Churches, and ſince that this courſe is duly obſerved. So both your Art. <hi>(W. R.)</hi> (you ſee) are true, and your report honeſt and right.</p>
               <p>Yet, withall let me give [you] a few <hi>Animadverſions,</hi> by way of bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly counſell, and I pray take them well.</p>
               <p n="1">1. See, what it is to wrong ſo many godly Saints, and faithfull Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches upon private various informations, and your own miſtakes, and ſo breake that 9. Commandement of our ever bleſſed God.</p>

               <p n="3">3. When a matter lies before you, that admits a double conſtruction; be ſure you ever take it in the better, and not in the worſer ſenſe.

               <p>For 1. It is a received practiſe amongſt us, that when any combine into a Church, there is one at leaſt of them indued with able parts of humane and divine learning, that either hath been a Miniſter in our native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, or is fit to be one amongſt them, who uſually and frequently preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to them after they are united. So that al of them are not men illiterate,<note place="margin">☜</note> and <hi>W. R.</hi> himſelfe knowes this to be true, for the Anſwer to the 32. queſt. 42. (which is very page hee here quotes) directly ſaith this in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny words:</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That thoſe illiterate men do examine their Miniſters abilities, and that we hold they ought;</hi> is another great miſtake, for ſo wee ſhould put men upon a worke beyond their reach, which were idle; whereas the truth is, that (if the ſuffici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. <hi>For their unmaking and depoſing them againe when they ſee cauſe;</hi> Wee hold and profeſſe it a thing moſt injurious to Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven &amp; to his Miniſters on earth, and ſuch a thing, as (not only Chriſt will ſummon Churches at the great day to anſwer unto, but) our Churches there will alſo expect ſatisfaction from them for it, if they ſhould thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Miniſters (as he ſaith) <hi>when they ſee cauſe,</hi> unleſſe Chriſt himſelfe ſhall ſee good cauſe to allow their fact to be done according to the rules of his owne word. Wee are ſo farre from holding this, that wee proteſt againſt ſuch practiſes.</p>
               <p>And to ſhew how wary wee are in this point, no Church dares truſt her owne judgement: but our manner is, as his quoted Authour ſpeakes. Anſwer to 34. q. of p. 41. <hi>Our practiſe is in removall of Miniſters to have counſell and aſſiſtance from ſiſter Churches.</hi>

Whereas he ſaith alſo, <hi>That we hold that men illiterate ſhould preach with all authority</hi> (which is a worke and a taske for the ableſt Miniſters to performe) is as farre from us, as any of the other. For though wee deny not, but in ſome caſe, ſome able judicious experienced Chriſtians, may
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:124596:24"/> humbly &amp; ſoberly, when neceſsity requires, as in the want of Miniſters &amp; being invited thereunto, diſpence now and then a word of exhortation to their brethren. This is farre enough from Preaching in an ordinary way, <hi>with all Authority;</hi> which are words of his owne, put in without any ground.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But for him to adde <hi>that we hold they may thus preach when they have Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and that without any reference at all to them,</hi> is extreamly contrary to our practiſe, and furtheſt from the truth. For this would directly croſſe Chriſt his inſtitution of calling Officers in his Church, and make meere cyphers of them, whoſe Office it is not onely to preach, but to rule and governe the Aſſembly, to open the doore of ſpeech to any in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and to ſhut it up by ſilence, ſo that none may ſo much as ſpeak without his allowance.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note>And this expreſſion of his is contrary to his owne Narration in Art. 8. where he ſaith, <hi>That ſome of the Acts we aſcribe to our Miniſters in Office, are to declare unto their people the minde of God, and to moderate in Church-meetings:</hi> yet here he ſpeakes cleane contrary to himſelfe and the truth alſo.</p>

               <p>Now let us ſee what grounds our Nartatour hath to lay all theſe char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges againſt us.

                  <hi>We grant that ſeverall Churches have a communion amongſt themſelves— in ſome Church-ordinances, as Sacraments:</hi> how can both be true? <hi>They hold, and they hold not; They do, &amp; they do not:</hi> ſpeaking ſtill of the Churches of <hi>New England</hi> generally without the leaſt reſtraint or diſtinction; yea as if hee had ſtudied to make his contradiction full, he expreſly and in both parts of it mentioneth the Sacraments; <hi>that wee deny communion, in ſpeciall, in [Sacraments] and we grant a communion, in ſpeciall, in the [Sacraments:]</hi> and againe, <hi>this communion</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is neither betwixt Miniſters nor members, and this communion is both betwixt Miniſters and members.</hi> And both of them within a leafe one of the other, in his booke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>W. R.</hi> himſelfe muſt of neceſſity grant one of theſe three things; either, 1 a manifeſt contradiction by himſelfe in a maine point in his ſtory. Or 2. that his Authors or intelligences have written or ſpoken contrary concerning our way. And ſo a man would thinke hee hath little ground (in conſcience) to build his Narration upon their teſtimony. Or thirdly, that hath abuſed them at his pleaſure, and warped their words to what ſenſe he liſt, all which are very ill in a Narrator.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, I here confidently avouch, and ſhall make it good; that thoſe printed writers by him cited, are all conſiſtent to themſelves in this point of adminiſtration of Sacraments to members of other Churches, and not one of them croſſing another or himſelf. Therefore I muſt againe (but with griefe of heart to lay ſuch load on a brother) lay this dealing upon him, in the ſight of all that have beene miſled by his Narration.</p>
               <p>Nay, I will ſay more; If I can not prove plainly that theſe Authors cited doe not only not juſtifie him, but write point-blanck againſt him, I will beare the blame. <hi>vid. Anſ.</hi> 9. <hi>Poſ.</hi> 62. <hi>We doe not</hi> (ſay they) <hi>appropriate the ſeales only to members of our own Church, excluding all other Churches of Chriſt.</hi> and <hi>Cot. Cat.</hi> p. 7. <hi>The ſupper</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is diſpenced to the faithfull of the ſame body, or recommended to them by a like body,</hi> and <hi>Anſ.</hi> to 9. <hi>Poſ.</hi> 78. in theſe words. <hi>The members of other Churches doe mutually communicate at each others Churches, even as often as Gods providence leades them, and they deſire it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, if all this be not enough to open his abuſing us &amp; the truth; I will go further to ſhew you, that he ſtill cites the very ſame Author to prove both parts of this contradiction; (and this is no new thing, but frequent with him.) For in cap. 9. Art. 1. he cites <hi>Anſ.</hi> to 9. <hi>Poſ.</hi> 62. to prove we hold communion with other Churches and their members: and alſo cap. 10. 1. he cites the ſame Author and page for one Churches communion with another in the Sacrament. But herein Art. 5. when hee would prove the contrary. <hi>i. e. that we hold no communion with other Church members in the Sacrament:</hi> he brings the ſelfe ſame Author and page for that end, <hi>i. e. Anſ.</hi> to 9. <hi>Poſ.</hi> pag. 62, &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:124596:31"/>
               <p>And thus he doth not with that mentioned one Author only, but ſerves the reſt in like manner, as <hi>Anſ.</hi> to 32. q. <hi>Apol. R.M.</hi> to <hi>E.B.</hi> muſt all come in to avouch both parts of his contradiction; the one in chap. 10. 1. for communion; the other in Art. 4. 5. of this 9. chap. againſt Communion. And this he doth not this once onely, but in other places in this booke (as we have ſhewed; and ſhall againe) and yet theſe Authors give him no occaſion thereto, but ſpeake all the ſelfe ſame thing plainely, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly without any variation.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> He ſaith, Art. 7. <hi>We hold that a man that is ſui juris, may not lawfully ſtand a member of ſuch a Church in which he cannot enioy all Gods ordinances, or where any corruption is ſuffered, but if he be ioyned to it, he muſt ſeparate from it.</hi>

If God had not pittifully left him to himſelfe in this Narration, (I am confident) he would not have come thus farre as to have uſed ſuch arguments as theſe, that <hi>if we in New-England allow ſet formes of Pſalmes, and of bleſſings of the people, and formes of Church-covenants; and of Catechiſing, &amp;c.

               </p>
               <p>Here are three particulars affirmed, and hardly any one of them true: <label type="milestone">

               <p n="8">8. And for one proofe of all thoſe he brings <hi>Anſ.</hi> to 32. q. 77. wherein is nothing to proove any one of the particulars mentiond, but ſomethings rather againſt him.

               <p>Now upon theſe premiſes unfoundly laid, hee builds many clamorous conſtructions in his Marg. which of themſelves muſt needs fall with the ruines of their foundation, without any trouble of mine.</p>

Solomon, Auſtin, &amp;c. never gained ſo much, as by their retractations. There are ſome ſinnes, God will not ſenſe up the pardon of, till ſatisfaction be made by the party: Defamation is one of them. It wil be no griefe of heart, but much comfort, to remember (when you are about to leave this world,) that although, through praecipitancy, you did blemiſh your Brethren, yet) after conſideration you did againe as readily, wipe away the blot, by a brotherly vindication as for as truth required; which if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
